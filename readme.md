# KTH Subsystem - Edu4Chip

This project is a small FFT implementation developed at KTH using the **SiLago Framework**.

A library of all the coarse-grain components required to implement the FFT—such as the Butterfly Unit, Address Generation Unit (AGU), and Data Processing Unit (DPU) for complex numbers—has been created.

This component library is used by the **Vesyla-Suite** to generate both the *subsystem* and the corresponding *binary file*.
